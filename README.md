LuckyBar
========

If you enter a value into Firefox's location bar that does not resolve as a
hostname, Firefox automatically issues a Google search.

Up until Firefox 3.6, the default behavior was to execute a **I'm Feeling
Lucky** search, i.e., to take you straight to the most likely search result
for the value you entered. In Firefox 4, this behavior was changed to issue
a regular Google search instead. If you have become used to the previous
behavior and want to change it back, this add-on will do exactly that.

Uninstalling
------------
Should you want to uninstall this add-on, go to ``about:addons`` and click
uninstall. The add-on will reset the preference's value to the state it was
in before the add-on was initially installed, unless it has changed since.
